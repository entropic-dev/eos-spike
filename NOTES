# NOTES SOMETIME IN THE PAST

goal: transfer objects between two processes

- iterate events
- write events through a cli
- output hashes when you add an object

# NOTES 2/11

- Iterator testing
    - wire up the iterator to the ReadableStore trait
    - time it, explore using making a "PartialEvent" struct that
      only parses the bitmask
    - Wire up the iterator to a command (eos)
    - Verification once we have an iterator
- Niceties
    - Envelope grew a "content_address" method, start outputing that content address when adding new items to the store
    - Add a "eos init" to create the cache directory structure
    - Start speccing out version objects
